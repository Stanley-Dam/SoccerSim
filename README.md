After reading the assignment I quickly started working on this [initial class diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1__MOcfRyjXJjwldVApxFsPZ1-wdfPiGW/view?usp=sharing), where I was able to construct a system that loads the data async into memory, it also removes frames it doesn't need anymore.
You can find the actual system in the [Simulator folder](https://github.com/Stanley-Dam/SoccerSim/tree/main/Assets/Simulator).
